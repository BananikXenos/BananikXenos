Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kristián Kekeš, a passionate programmer and technology enthusiast from Slovakia. This is where I showcase my projects and contributions to the world of software development.

## About Me

I'm a 16-year-old student with a burning passion for programming and computers. I'm currently studying at Stredná odborná škola elektrotechnická in Liptovský Hrádok, where I'm constantly learning and exploring the vast realms of technology.

With a strong foundation in programming, I enjoy working with various languages such as Java, C#, Python, and web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also experienced in Android development, game development using Unity, and computer vision with OpenCV.
